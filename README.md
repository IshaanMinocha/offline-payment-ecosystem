### The Problem

In semi-urban and rural areas, digital payments suffer due to:

- Lack of stable internet causing transaction failures.
- Delayed fraud detection, especially when backend checks aren't instantly reachable.
- High failure rates during bank server downtimes or poor connectivity.
- Slow payment processing from inefficient gateway routing.
- No current method for secure offline transactions or intelligent payment routing.

This results in:

- Lost sales opportunities, especially for small vendors and ground workers.
- High operational friction, leaving entire regions digitally excluded.

### Our Solution

A mesh-network-based offline digital payments ecosystem, combining:

- Blockchain-powered store & forward for syncing transactions from offline devices.
- Mesh networking (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Direct/NFC) to relay transactions securely until they reach an internet node.
- Client-side ML fraud detection that works even offline using lightweight TensorFlow Lite + Isolation Forest models.
- AI-powered payment routing based on gateway success rate, transaction costs, and user preferences.

This enables seamless, secure, and fast transactionsâ€”even without internet.

### Algorithms Implemented

| Model | Purpose | Tech Stack |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Fraud Detection (TFLite + IF) | Detect malicious transaction patterns locally and flag risks before backend validation. | TensorFlow Lite, Scikit-Learn, Isolation Forest |
| Dynamic Payment Router | Selects best gateway route using ML + user reward preferences. | FastAPI, gRPC, NumPy, Pandas, Custom Scoring |
